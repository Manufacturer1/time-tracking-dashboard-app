## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindui.com/) - React framework

### What I learned

I've learned a lot about how to manage components, how to create resuable components in React and a little bit of css grid.
Also i'm pretty proud of finding a solution to style the dashboard-card-component wich took me a pretty good amount of time finding an optimal soulution.
